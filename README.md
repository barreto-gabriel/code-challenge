# Relevant Information

#### Highlights of your improvements (tests and others you choose)
I have written tests for App and TemperatureTable components. I tried to cover the most important business rules, taking in consideration temperature rules, displaying important information on the screen anc integration with the Temperature API.
#### Future improvements
Did not have enough time to improve the TemperatureTable integration test, so it is taking in consideration all 6 products in the data file, when it is not necessary, I believe also mocking this integration would have been better.
#### Approach
Tried to cover the most relevant scenarios to improve test coverage, and also refactoring to make code simpler and more readle.
